# K2 AWS S3 integration through JSSP
This currently does not work with K2 Nexus at time of writing (September 10, 2020). AWS S3 integration requires dependencies like aws-sdk or at least crypto-js to work properly. This code is here for possible use in the future as the K2 JSSP feature continues to grow.
